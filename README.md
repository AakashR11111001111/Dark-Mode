## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the page, including the toggle button and heading.
- **style.css**: Styles for the light and dark mode backgrounds, toggle button, and heading.
- **script.js**: JavaScript for switching between light and dark modes, with the toggle button sliding to indicate the active mode.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Click the button to switch between dark and light backgrounds.
- **Animated Toggle Slider**: The toggle slider moves left or right with a smooth transition to indicate the selected mode.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Flexbox for centering elements.

## Files

- **HTML**: Sets up the structure for the main container, toggle button, and heading.
- **CSS**: Adds styling for the container, button, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the toggle functionality and transitions between modes.

## How It Works

1. When the toggle button is clicked, JavaScript checks the current background color of the main container.
2. The background color switches between light and dark.
3. The toggle slider's position changes to indicate the active mode.
